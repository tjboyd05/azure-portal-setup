# azure-portal-setup
Initial Azure Portal customization and pinned services as part of AZ-900 prep.
## ðŸ“Š Dashboard â€“ Pinned Services (Tiles Visible)

### Overview
This step documents my customized Azure Portal dashboard used for AZ-900 practice.  
Because the Azure Portal no longer shows a pin ðŸ“Œ on every service blade, I used **Dashboard Edit mode** to add tiles for my most-used services.

### Services Displayed on Dashboard
- Kubernetes services
- Virtual machines
- Storage accounts
- VMware vCenters
- Virtual networks

### Steps I Followed
1. Opened the **Dashboard** from the left menu.  
2. Selected **Edit** to enter customization mode.  
3. Used the **Tile gallery** to search for each service.  
4. Dragged the following tiles to the dashboard canvas:  
   - Kubernetes services  
   - Virtual machines  
   - Storage accounts  
   - VMware vCenters  
   - Virtual networks  
5. Arranged the tiles into a grid layout for easy viewing.  
6. Clicked **Done customizing** to save the dashboard.  
7. Captured screenshots to document the setup.  

### Why this matters
- Demonstrates knowledge of the current Azure Portal workflow (Edit mode vs. legacy pin).  
- Improves productivity by surfacing the services Iâ€™ll use during AZ-900 labs.  
- Provides visible proof of Azure hands-on work.
